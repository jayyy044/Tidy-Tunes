<h3>The Playlist page gathers the users playlists and requires them to choose one they would like the website to track following this it creates the users music taste off the audio features of the most popular songs and most recent songs. I then use this compiled music to run a similarity analysis on five randmon songs already in that playlist so that users can keep their playlist up to date with their current music taste, removing the tedious task of skipping through 4-5 songs before you start listening. The pages comes with buttons to change the playlist your want the website to track and a refresh button so you can get a new set of analyzed songs. Additionally, the page also has their most recently played songs and most recently added songs.</h3>

<!--  This stock management website was created to design a user-friendly way to manage all your favorite stocks in a customizable dashboard. The application features a search page where users can search for their desired stock by symbol, name or industry. There is also an insights page which uses Facebook's Prohpet forecasting procedure to predict a stock's price one day into the future based on its historical closing prices. External API's are used to retrieve real-time stock prices, analyst recommendations, and up-to-date news. The frontend is a React.js application which utilizes components from the Ant Design UI library and the backend is a Node.js and Express.js API which handles requests from the frontend to manipulate a MongoDB database. The authentication for this application involves a user's email and password which is then hashed using the bcryptjs library and stored as a document in a collection. The authorization for the app is controlled by JWT's (JSON web tokens) to mediate access rights between logged in and non-logged in users. The frontend is deployed on Netlify and the backend is deployed on AWS as an EC2 instance. -->
