<!--  This stock management website was created to design a user-friendly way to manage all your favorite stocks in a customizable dashboard. The application features a search page where users can search for their desired stock by symbol, name or industry. There is also an insights page which uses Facebook's Prohpet forecasting procedure to predict a stock's price one day into the future based on its historical closing prices. External API's are used to retrieve real-time stock prices, analyst recommendations, and up-to-date news. The frontend is a React.js application which utilizes components from the Ant Design UI library and the backend is a Node.js and Express.js API which handles requests from the frontend to manipulate a MongoDB database. The authentication for this application involves a user's email and password which is then hashed using the bcryptjs library and stored as a document in a collection. The authorization for the app is controlled by JWT's (JSON web tokens) to mediate access rights between logged in and non-logged in users. The frontend is deployed on Netlify and the backend is deployed on AWS as an EC2 instance. -->
